CampusEye: Next-Gen Intelligent Surveillance System
===================================================

CampusEye is an advanced real-time surveillance and attendance management system that leverages face recognition technology to identify registered students, log their presence, and send automated alerts to administrators.

🚀 Key Features
---------------

*   **Real-time Face Recognition**: Utilizes the DeepFace library with Facenet to detect and identify faces from a live camera feed.
    
*   **Student Management Dashboard**: A web-based interface built with Flask to add, edit, and delete student profiles.
    
*   **Automated Alerts**: Sends instant email notifications with live captures of detected students via EmailJS.
    
*   **Attendance Logging**: Automatically records student presence in a local attendance.csv file and a MongoDB database.
    
*   **Report Generation**: Export detection records and attendance logs as CSV reports directly from the dashboard.
    
*   **Time-Slot Monitoring**: Surveillance logic can be configured to run only during specific designated hours.
    

🛠️ Technology Stack
--------------------

*   **Backend**: Python, Flask
    
*   **Database**: MongoDB (PyMongo)
    
*   **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, DeepFace (Facenet)
    
*   **Cloud Storage**: Cloudinary (for storing student photographs)
    
*   **Email Service**: EmailJS
    
*   **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3
    

📋 Prerequisites
